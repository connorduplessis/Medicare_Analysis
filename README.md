The dataset includes hospital-specific charges for the more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals that receive Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) payments for the top 100 most frequently billed discharges, paid under Medicare based on a rate per discharge using the Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2011. These DRGs represent more than 7 million discharges or 60 percent of total Medicare IPPS discharges.The dataset includes 12 variables across 163,065 observations.

The analysis is currently broken out over two documents: Medicare_State_Comarison and Variation. The Medicare_State_Comparison analysis calculates state rankings based on their average claim costs. You will also find a map that attempts to highlight particular regions that may be more expensive than others. The Variation analysis attempts to quantify the variability of charges across states and DRG's.
